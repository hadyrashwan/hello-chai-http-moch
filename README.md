# hello-chai-http-moch

this isn't my code I just applied the tutorial from here

https://scotch.io/tutorials/test-a-node-restful-api-with-mocha-and-chai

u need to support es6 so old nodejs version will face problems 

SET thing in npm start wasn't working for me 

I used the follwoing command instead

NODE_ENV={{your_enviroment}} node server.js
